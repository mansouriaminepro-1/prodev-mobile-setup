# Welcome to Your Expo App 👋

This project was generated using `create-expo-app`—a fast and simple way to start building universal React applications for iOS, Android, and the web.

## Get Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install

2. Start the Development Server
npx expo start
Once the development server is running, you’ll see several options to launch your app:

Development build (for full native capabilities)
Android emulator
iOS simulator
Expo Go — a sandboxed environment ideal for quick prototyping and learning
3. Start Coding
Edit files inside the app/ directory to build your app. This project uses file-based routing, so the structure of the app/ folder defines your app’s navigation.

Start Fresh (Optional)
If you'd like a clean slate to build from, run:

bash
1
This moves the current starter code into an app-example/ folder and replaces app/ with an empty directory—perfect for beginning your own implementation.
