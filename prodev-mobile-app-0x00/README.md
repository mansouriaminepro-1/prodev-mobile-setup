# Welcome to Your Expo App 👋

This project was generated using `create-expo-app`—a fast and simple way to start building universal React applications for iOS, Android, and the web.

## Get Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the App

```bash
npx expo start
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- **Development build**
- **Android emulator**
- **iOS simulator**
- **Expo Go** - a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses **file-based routing**.

## Get a Fresh Project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
